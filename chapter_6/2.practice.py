""" 
if we write :
            print("xyz") 
            print("ujj")

            then xyz and ujj will be printed in 2 different lines, but we can print then in same line using "end"

            print("xyz", end = " "), basically end will decide how to end the print function, its default value is \n that's why after every print call, we get shifted to the next line

"""
print("hello", end = " ")
print("Ram", end = " * ") # it will ends with *
print("mum", end = " ")
