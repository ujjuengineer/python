<h1>Python Learning Journey</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn Python, exploring various concepts, and building projects.</p>
<br>

<h2>üìö About</h2>
<p>As a first-year engineering student with a background in C++, C#, and DSA, I am now diving into Python. This repository will contain scripts, notes, and projects that reflect my learning journey, from the basics to more advanced topics.</p>

<h2>üîç Structure</h2>
<p>
  <li> Basics: Fundamental Python concepts such as data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.  </li>
  <li> Intermediate: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), modules, file handling, and exception handling. </li>
  <li> Advanced: Working with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and exploring data structures, algorithms, and more. </li>
  <li> Projects: Mini-projects and assignments to apply the concepts learned. </li>
